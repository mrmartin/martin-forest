Martin Forest 1.0

by Martin Kolar, 12.2013

Train a random forest of Entropy-reducing trees on a csv input, capable of multiclass classification. The trained forest is a .forest file.
Evaluate a set of unlabeled data from a csv file, which can handle '?' for unknown values. The output .classification file is a csv of votes from each tree. The votes for each label are added, for selection or ranking applications.


COMPILING:
compile with Eigen (eigen.tuxfamily.org), using
g++ evaluate_multiclass_forest.cpp -o forest_eval -std=gnu++11
and
g++ train_multiclass_forest.cpp -o forest_train -std=gnu++11

FILE FORMAT:


USAGE:
training: (as of version 1.0, rows with '?' entries are ignored)
./forest_train *training csv file* *number of trees* *.forest output file*
./forest_train ../Wisconsin_Breast_Cancer_train.csv 5 breast.forest

evaluation:
./forest_eval *testing csv file* *.forest input file* *.classification output file*
./forest_eval ../Wisconsin_Breast_Cancer_test_nolabels.csv breast.forest breast.classification
