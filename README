Martin Forest 1.0

by Martin Kolar, 12.2013

Train a random forest of Entropy-reducing trees on a csv input, capable of multiclass classification. The trained forest is stored in a .forest file.

Evaluate a set of unlabeled data from a csv file, which can handle '?' for unknown values. The output .classification file is a csv of votes from each tree. The votes for each label are summed over all trees, for selection or ranking applications. A tree may be uncertain when deciding in a node (when the value is '?'), and will follow both branches.


COMPILING:
compile with Eigen (eigen.tuxfamily.org), using
g++ evaluate_multiclass_forest.cpp -o forest_eval -std=gnu++11
and
g++ train_multiclass_forest.cpp -o forest_train -std=gnu++11


FILE FORMAT:
Training file:
label, value1, value2, value3, ..., valueN
label, value1, value2, value3, ..., valueN

Testing file:
value1, value2, value3, ..., valueN
value1, value2, value3, ..., valueN

Output .classification file:
label1, label2, label3, ..., labelL (a list of all labels, so that the order is clear)
votes_label1, votes_label2, votes_label3, ..., votes_labelL
votes_label1, votes_label2, votes_label3, ..., votes_labelL

(for real examples, see the real world files:
Training file: Wisconsin_Breast_Cancer_train.csv
Testing file: Wisconsin_Breast_Cancer_test_nolabels.csv
Output .classification file: breast.classification


USAGE:
training: (as of version 1.0, rows with '?' entries are ignored)
./forest_train *training csv file* *number of trees* *.forest output file*
./forest_train ../Wisconsin_Breast_Cancer_train.csv 5 breast.forest

evaluation:
./forest_eval *testing csv file* *.forest input file* *.classification output file*
./forest_eval ../Wisconsin_Breast_Cancer_test_nolabels.csv breast.forest breast.classification
